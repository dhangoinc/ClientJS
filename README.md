# dhango ClientJS

## Environment Setup

 - install dependencies `npm install`
 - run client js dev environment `npm start`

The commands above will run a `lite-server` http server on a `localhost:3000` which will serve the `index.html` with 
the client javascript and css files included. With this basic setup you can start adding changes to
`clientscript.v<version>.js`.
